    "timestamp": "00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:18,593",
    "suggestion": "Improve visual specificity: Replace the generic blurry background shot (Keyframe 4) with visuals that directly illustrate 'congestion and road accidents' mentioned in the subtitles. Review if repeating the main title card is necessary for structure or if it's redundant."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:00:47,522 --> 00:01:03,277",
    "suggestion": "Reduce visual clutter: Consider slightly simplifying the layout. For example, fade the text overlay ('Widening roads often leads to more traffic...') in and out rather than having it constantly present with the talking head and dynamic background footage, or use the talking head less persistently during B-roll segments."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:24,046",
    "suggestion": "Replace placeholder logo: Update the 'logoipsum' placeholder in the top-left corner with the actual brand logo or remove it if unnecessary."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:39,890",
    "suggestion": "Improve speaker visual engagement: Select takes where the speaker maintains better eye contact or appears more visually engaged (e.g., avoiding frames where eyes are closed) to enhance viewer connection."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:59,066",
    "suggestion": "Enhance speaker integration and quality: Consider improving the sharpness/resolution of the speaker cutout to better match the high quality of the B-roll footage. Explore potentially more dynamic visual integration of the speaker than the basic cutout."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:17,873",
    "suggestion": "Add illustrative visuals: Incorporate relevant B-roll footage or graphics (e.g., images of aging roads, broken infrastructure) to visually support the speaker's discussion on urban infrastructure quality, enhancing modality matching. Also, replace the placeholder logo."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:48,180",
    "suggestion": "Refine visuals and branding: Replace the 'logoipsum' placeholder. Ensure B-roll shots clearly show the subject (avoid foreground obstructions). Consider a more visually integrated graphic design for the talking head/text overlay. Verify final subtitle implementation meets readability standards (size, contrast, timing)."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:02:50,435 --> 00:03:10,362",
    "suggestion": "Incorporate relevant B-roll: Add visuals related to cycling infrastructure (e.g., bike lanes, street designs, cyclists) to directly illustrate the topic being discussed by the speaker and enhance modality matching."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:24,797",
    "suggestion": "Replace placeholder logo: Update the 'logoipsum' placeholder with the actual brand identifier for a professional final product."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:34,343",
    "suggestion": "Align visuals with specific topic: Replace generic app mockups with visuals more directly related to inclusive *city* design (e.g., accessible ramps, parks, transit app features for accessibility) or adjust the script/text to explicitly link the app design process shown to the broader goals of inclusive cities."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:48,601",
    "suggestion": "Improve visual relevance and branding: Replace the 'logoipsum' placeholder logo. Incorporate B-roll or graphics related to traffic collisions, road design, or urban environments to strengthen the connection between visuals and the spoken topic."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:22,288",
    "suggestion": "Replace irrelevant B-roll: Critically replace the background footage of concrete pouring with visuals directly related to the narration's topic of road safety, smart planning, data analysis, or city streets to fix the severe modality mismatch."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:41,118",
    "suggestion": "Replace placeholder logo: Update the 'logoipsum' placeholder logo with the actual brand logo for the final version."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:17,737",
    "suggestion": "Improve talking head video quality: Enhance the resolution and/or reduce compression artifacts on the talking head video to match the quality of the background footage and graphics for a more seamless visual experience."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:53,959",
    "suggestion": "Replace placeholder logo: Update the 'logoipsum' placeholder with the actual brand logo for a professional final appearance."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:05:56,465 --> 00:06:19,054",
    "suggestion": "Strengthen signaling: Make the text overlay more dynamic by highlighting key terms or concepts as they are mentioned in the narration/subtitles, rather than keeping it static throughout the chunk."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:32,729",
    "suggestion": "Enhance background relevance and text contrast: Consider using a background image subtly related to urban environments instead of the generic dark one. Improve text readability by adding a subtle background scrim or outline to the on-screen text overlay."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:44,760",
    "suggestion": "Correct branding and technical glitch: Replace placeholder 'logoipsum' and 'email@yourcompany.com' with actual branding/contact info. Fix the editing error causing the main text overlay ('Cities turning data into action') to disappear momentarily mid-segment."
